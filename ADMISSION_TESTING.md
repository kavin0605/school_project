# Admission System Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Admission Applications Not Showing
**Problem**: Applications were being stored in MongoDB but not displaying in admin dashboard.
**Solution**: Fixed API response handling - server returns `data.data` but client was expecting `data.applications`.

### 2. Application Approval Missing Required Data
**Problem**: Approval endpoint requires roll number, class, section, and passwords but wasn't being provided.
**Solution**: Updated approval function to prompt admin for required information.

## How to Test:

### 1. Submit Online Applications
1. Go to the website homepage
2. Click "Admission" in navigation
3. Fill out the admission form completely
4. Submit the application
5. Note the application number returned

### 2. View Applications in Admin Panel
1. Login as admin (nalandaschool1985@gmail.com / nalanda1985)
2. Go to "Admission Applications" tab
3. You should see submitted applications with status "pending"

### 3. Approve Applications
1. In admin panel, find the application to approve
2. Click "Approve" button
3. Enter required information when prompted:
   - Roll Number (e.g., 101)
   - Class (e.g., 9th Grade)
   - Section (e.g., A)
   - Student Password (min 6 characters)
   - Parent Password (min 6 characters)
4. Application will be approved and student/parent accounts created
5. **ðŸ“§ Automatic email sent to parent** with:
   - Admission confirmation details
   - Document submission instructions (original documents required)
   - **1-week deadline** to meet and submit documents
   - School contact information and office hours
   - Login credential information

### 4. Sample Data Available
The server automatically creates 2 sample admission applications for testing:
- Rahul Sharma (9th Grade) - Application #ADM20250001
- Priya Kumar (10th Grade) - Application #ADM20250002
